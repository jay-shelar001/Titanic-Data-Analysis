Dataset: train.csv  
Source: Kaggle (Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster)

🛠 Tools Used  
Python  
Pandas  
Matplotlib  
Seaborn  
Kaggle Notebook  

📊 Analysis Performed  
Data loading and cleaning  
Missing value handling  
Removal of unnecessary columns  
Survival analysis by gender  
Survival analysis by passenger class  
Age group analysis  
Correlation matrix analysis  

📈 Visualizations
